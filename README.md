# Updates
--> New Shooting Mode and detailed information on controls in a separate controls page                   
--> Accelerometer support which means that you can now tilt the device (as long as its a touch screen device with accelerometer support) to move the player (please read the controls page in the game). <FOR THIS I MIGHT GIVE A DOWNLOAD LINK TO THE APP CAUSE THE ACCELEROMETER DOES NOT WORK IN BROWSER FOR SOME REASON>
